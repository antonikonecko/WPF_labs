# Sequence Pattern Finder README

**This application is designed to identify specific nucleotide patterns within DNA sequence.**

1. **User-Friendly Interface:** The application provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that makes it easy to interact with the program's functionalities.

2. **File Selection:** The application allows you to choose a file containing a DNA sequence. Once selected, the sequence will be loaded and ready for analysis.

3. **Nucleotide Identification:** With the click of a button, the application employs a sophisticated algorithm to identify and count the occurrences of different nucleotides within the loaded sequence.

4. **Results Display:** The results of the nucleotide analysis are displayed in a clear and organized manner. You will see the names of the nucleotides along with the corresponding count of occurrences.

5. **Highlighting Occurrences:** The application offers a convenient Combobox that allows you to choose a specific nucleotide from the list. Upon selection, the occurrences of that nucleotide will be highlighted throughout the sequence, aiding in visualization.

6. **Two-Class Architecture:** The application is built using a two-class architecture. One class handles the graphical user interface (GUI), making the program visually appealing and easy to use. The other class is responsible for the algorithmic calculations, ensuring accurate and efficient nucleotide identification.
