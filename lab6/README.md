#  [Project 3 ](./lab3/README.md) Modification

## This project involves modifying the code from [Project 3 ](./lab3/README.md) to implement the following changes:

1. Modified the file writing process to utilize XML serialization for data storage.
2. Implemented data loading through XML deserialization.
3. Added a feature that prompts the user to save the content when closing the program.
4. Enabled the program to load data from the last opened location upon startup.
5. Introduced a search option that allows searching by last name or count number.
6. Display search results in a separate window or within the main table.
7. Enhanced the search functionality to differentiate between searching by counts and searching by last names:
   - When a number is entered in the search textbox, the program searches by counts.
   - When text is entered in the search textbox, the program searches by last names.
